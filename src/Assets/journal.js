        description: `OK, so actually I hadn't planned for this thing, I'm not even sure if I'll use but I'm kinda seriously considering it rn
        Since this is day one I don't really wanna commit too hard to anything. I kinda suck at designing things so I was thinking maybe a layout like the IDV event going on rn would be kinda nice, you know, the one where you pick gifts and guess who's gifting em.
        Ngl tho since there's also an IDV journal it kinda feels like I'm taking everything from there... I SWEAR I'M NOT AN IDV ADDICT AND I'M TRYNA COME UP WITH SHIT MYSELF BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS
        Also I have two months so I'm sure there'll be some changes, right? You tell me. Making this gift is kinda hard cause what I'm tryna convey more than anything else is something meaningful, I REALLY DON'T WANNA BE CRUNCHY, I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS IN ANY OTHER WAY, but there's things you've done and said to me that really have meant the world.
        BRO THAT DAY YOU WENT FUCKING ALL CRUNCHY OUT OF NOWHERE AND FUCKING KO'D ME WAS CRAZY.
        No, but real real real Imma try hard to make this gift what I want it to be, hope you like it cause Imma pour my everything into itttttt.
        Also yesterday was the day you said we should study cats so we can also eat ourselves out, CRAZYYYYYYYYYYYYY.
        DAY ONE OVER, SEE YOU TOMORROW`

        description: `Now I think I got a good and kinda original idea, Imma make a soup, like an actual soup. Basically it's the gifts thing I was telling you about but in soup, and it's kinda like every single thing in there is a part of you, what makes you who you are.
        I didn't have much time today cause I had to get college + the other course I'm taking shit done but tomorrow Imma start with the actual coding part. Also we played like infinite hours today so I blame you too. With all that talk about you sucking Shenhe's toes and all that you made me laugh so fucking hard my chest started to hurt, then we both got legendaries from the Poketwo bot and lost like four duo matches in a row. A pretty good day I'd say.`

        description: `I got the biggest scam ever, IT'S FUCKING LIT. All I gotta do is trick you into drawing the soup and the ingredients so I can use em later, AM I A GENIUS OR WHAT?
        I'm about to get started with the code so there's at least a structure to fit that into.
        We haven't talked yet so can't update on that but looking forward to asking if your gases got better :D
        This line is like half an hour later but now that I'm coding the thing I have to wonder if it's better to make the ingredient thing like a memory, like special moments or things you've done for me or if it's better to write something myself.
        Last year I also did a memories thing so I'm not too sure if it wouldn't be kinda repetitive, thing is tho I wanna show appreciaton but I also wanna remind you of how awesome you're so I'm a bit conflicted.
        Well, it's whatever, there's almost two months left so I'll figure it out, I'm just setting the outlines rn, I BELIEVEEEEEEEEE.`

        description:  `Well, scam was successful and I think I convinced you to do it, tho I'm not sure if you remember... I'll remind you later anyways.
        Today I'm not really sure if Imma do anything coding related to this so instead let's just talk about a nice moment we had yesterday / this morning.
        WAIT WRITING THIS I HAD AN IDEA OF HOW THIS COULD GO INTO A MEMORY, MAYBE I'LL ACTUALLY AT LEAST CODE THAT.
        No but without going into too much detail cause it'd be too long and I'm still not sure how long I want these entries to be, I told you about my being a bit underweight thing now and the way you reacted like, I knew you were like this but seeing it once again reminded me of how proud I am of what you've become and also made me feel really happy of being your friend.
        You know, back when I met you you used to show you cared by hurting yourself, by closing yourself, by trying not to bother others but it was also a bit like you were afraid, like you couldn't show your true self and you were scared of people leaving you. And while to some extent I know you still do that, today you've proven me that it's not your only way to show appreciation, cause now you can also show you care but in a positive way, by being there for others, by expressing your thoughts with words and by actually sharing how you feel and I'm really proud of you for that.
        I could also say it like, you've grown into a warm person, it's just so nice to have you as a friend you can't even begin to imagine and I'm very grateful for that.
        AND FR YOU GO ALL "ITS JUST BASIC SHIT CHILL" BUT ITS NOT, SO LEMME JUST END THIS BY THANKING YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING THERE CAUSE IT'S NOT BASIC SHIT IT'S YOU SHIT.`

        description: `Ayooooooooo what's poppin my lad? For today's update we haveeeeeee: the ingredient thing has its structure done, I also coded the function that makes it open on click but still taking it quite chill.
        Gotta say tho yesterday I was kinda mentally gone cause I ranked too much on IDV but WTF you surprised me so much. NO FLAME AT ALL but you sometimes forget stuff so I thought I'd have to remind you of the soup drawing. It surprised me a lot that not only you remembered but you even told me you were watching tutorials on how to draw it well, like broooooooo, I feel bad for doubting on that but at the same time it's times like these that make me realize how good of a friend you're.
        The amount of effort you put in even in these small things make me appreciate you a whole lot, HAHAHAHA I REMEMBER YESTERDAY I KINDA SAID SOMETHING SIMILAR, NO? I don't want these entries to be too repetitive so if you're reading this just know you're truly amazing and OMG I won the fucking lottery by having a friend like you.
        Unrelated but I won't stop stealing your Genshin butterflies, those are mine sorry.`

        description: `No cap I'm still not sure what this journal is about so I'll keep writing whatever I guess.
        Today is a bit diff cause for the past days I was writing about what we did the day before + beginning of that day but for today cause we didn't talk yesterday I'll only write today's shit. A whole lot tho cause, fuck me, most of the day went straight up into our convo.
        I was actually getting a bit worried today cause you hadn't played anything in two days and were taking forever to reply, which tbf is pretty normal, but I wasn't gonna say anything until tomorrow in case in reality it was nothing. Turns out you got sick af and yeah, basically fucking dying.
        Besides that I swear I can't tell if I'm dumb af or what but the surprises never stop coming with you, playing on your IDV alt was a pretty nice gesture but I thought it was just cause it was your alt, but today you let me into your main like it's whatever. AND WANNA KNOW THE REASON WHY? YOUR ALT WAS THE ACCOUNT YOU SPENT MONEY ON SO YOU WERE LETTING ME INTO YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ACCOUNT AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. LIKE, BE HONEST, WHAT DO I EVEN DO AFTER THIS? BRO FUCKER IF YOU READ THIS LEMME SAY THE AMOUNT OF TRUST YOU PLACE IN ME, THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT YOU PUT IN, HOW MUCH YOU CARE, AND I'M NOT GONNA CONTINUE CAUSE I GOTTA LEAVE THINGS FOR OTHER ENTRIES BUT ALL THOSE THINGS, all the things you do, how do you even describe this? You're a fucking national treasure, a wordly treasure, you're legit irreplaceable, I don't think I could ever find anybody like you or even close.
        I did let you into my Genshin account after, which I know it's not the same but it's the minimum I could do, and honestly, the amount of trust I also have for you is HUGE, at no point I was worried while you were on it and you know anytime you wanna play on it again you're free too. Bro, fr, everyday with you is an experience HAHAHAHAH, you're gonna make me cry if this goes on, you're so fucking nice wtf, IS GETTING MOVED THIS MUCH EVERDAY HEALTHY? NO IDEA BUT 10/10 FRIEND, WOULD CALL CRY CHARACTERS UGLY AGAIN.`

        Imma add a skip thing to this entry or something so it doesn't even show on the thing`,
        skip: "Yes"

        date: "April 8th",
        description: `OKAYYYYY I GOT CONTENT. I think maybe tho I'll stop writing entries every single day cause I don't want this thing to be like infinite either, this is kinda an extra thing.
        I'm still mostly stalling cause waiting for the souppppppppppp.
        I gotta say tho, you're mad funny, you spammed me to sleep and you pull a fucking all-nighter for IDV, AND THEN YOU GO "NONONONO I HATE IDV", YOU SURE DO, NO DOUBT. Still got smacked on memory tho, no matter how tired I may be, no matter how strong the headache, no matter how much you can RNG the start, nothing can stop my 6 combo. G3T R3KT M8.
        Chill day all considered.`

        description: `Sup buddy! For once Imma write an entry that's only related to the project, okay? So I had an enlightenment moment and I kinda understand now what I wanna do with the ingredients. I want em to be like a card, with a memory in front and then you can turn em, an animation will play and everything, and then on the other side there'll be a note written by me, with a title attached and maybe something you also did? I think that's kinda what I wanna achieve with this, I want something that showcases our friendship, the way I see you and the way you show yourself. Cause I can say all the nice things I want and we can share all the nice moments we can but I think it's also important you realize this is only possible cause of what you do.
        Oh btw, unrelated but HAHAHAHAH, the "STOP BEING SO INTERESTING, YOU'RE MAKING ME AWFUL" compliment was kinda interesting, I'll save it as one of the niceirdest compliments I've received. Is that toxic? Idk, kinda sounds like it but thankssssssssss.`

        description: `I won't lie, I didn't write anything yesterday cause I was stressing about our friendship discussion, the one about who texts first, time spent and all that. BRO YOU CALLED ME OVER AND STARTED WTIH THE I WANNA BUY YOU A SHINY LUXRAY AND I WAS LIKE TF? WASN'T SHE GONNA FLAME THE SHIT OUT OF ME? Truly confused af, but honestly, why do I even doubt you anymore, you straight up just said the plan and the fact by next morning things had already changed really shows your character.
        I was thinking about how I wanted the ingredient cards to be and I think I have a clearer idea now, I want the memory to actually be on the back cause it's like a nice thing but not the main point, I want the front to be the meaningful part. And until now I didn't have a super clear idea and didn't know with what to start, but yesterday helped me figure a lot of shit out and that's why I decided to make that the first card.
        Ofc there has been lots of other good moments that I also treasure but this one in particular I feel like it's perfect for what I wanted, it's not gonna be the only one so I can still fit more shit.
        Oh and btw, thanks for listening to my personal stuff and sharing yours, actual peak friend. OK BYEEEEEEEE SAYANARA.`
