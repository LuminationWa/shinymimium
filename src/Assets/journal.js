        description: `OK, so actually I hadn't planned for this thing, I'm not even sure if I'll use but I'm kinda seriously considering it rn
        Since this is day one I don't really wanna commit too hard to anything. I kinda suck at designing things so I was thinking maybe a layout like the IDV event going on rn would be kinda nice, you know, the one where you pick gifts and guess who's gifting em.
        Ngl tho since there's also an IDV journal it kinda feels like I'm taking everything from there... I SWEAR I'M NOT AN IDV ADDICT AND I'M TRYNA COME UP WITH SHIT MYSELF BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS
        Also I have two months so I'm sure there'll be some changes, right? You tell me. Making this gift is kinda hard cause what I'm tryna convey more than anything else is something meaningful, I REALLY DON'T WANNA BE CRUNCHY, I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS IN ANY OTHER WAY, but there's things you've done and said to me that really have meant the world.
        BRO THAT DAY YOU WENT FUCKING ALL CRUNCHY OUT OF NOWHERE AND FUCKING KO'D ME WAS CRAZY.
        No, but real real real Imma try hard to make this gift what I want it to be, hope you like it cause Imma pour my everything into itttttt.
        Also yesterday was the day you said we should study cats so we can also eat ourselves out, CRAZYYYYYYYYYYYYY.
        DAY ONE OVER, SEE YOU TOMORROW`

        description: `Now I think I got a good and kinda original idea, Imma make a soup, like an actual soup. Basically it's the gifts thing I was telling you about but in soup, and it's kinda like every single thing in there is a part of you, what makes you who you are.
        I didn't have much time today cause I had to get college + the other course I'm taking shit done but tomorrow Imma start with the actual coding part. Also we played like infinite hours today so I blame you too. With all that talk about you sucking Shenhe's toes and all that you made me laugh so fucking hard my chest started to hurt, then we both got legendaries from the Poketwo bot and lost like four duo matches in a row. A pretty good day I'd say.`

        description: `I got the biggest scam ever, IT'S FUCKING LIT. All I gotta do is trick you into drawing the soup and the ingredients so I can use em later, AM I A GENIUS OR WHAT?
        I'm about to get started with the code so there's at least a structure to fit that into.
        We haven't talked yet so can't update on that but looking forward to asking if your gases got better :D
        This line is like half an hour later but now that I'm coding the thing I have to wonder if it's better to make the ingredient thing like a memory, like special moments or things you've done for me or if it's better to write something myself.
        Last year I also did a memories thing so I'm not too sure if it wouldn't be kinda repetitive, thing is tho I wanna show appreciaton but I also wanna remind you of how awesome you're so I'm a bit conflicted.
        Well, it's whatever, there's almost two months left so I'll figure it out, I'm just setting the outlines rn, I BELIEVEEEEEEEEE.`

        description:  `Well, scam was successful and I think I convinced you to do it, tho I'm not sure if you remember... I'll remind you later anyways.
        Today I'm not really sure if Imma do anything coding related to this so instead let's just talk about a nice moment we had yesterday / this morning.
        WAIT WRITING THIS I HAD AN IDEA OF HOW THIS COULD GO INTO A MEMORY, MAYBE I'LL ACTUALLY AT LEAST CODE THAT.
        No but without going into too much detail cause it'd be too long and I'm still not sure how long I want these entries to be, I told you about my being a bit underweight thing now and the way you reacted like, I knew you were like this but seeing it once again reminded me of how proud I am of what you've become and also made me feel really happy of being your friend.
        You know, back when I met you you used to show you cared by hurting yourself, by closing yourself, by trying not to bother others but it was also a bit like you were afraid, like you couldn't show your true self and you were scared of people leaving you. And while to some extent I know you still do that, today you've proven me that it's not your only way to show appreciation, cause now you can also show you care but in a positive way, by being there for others, by expressing your thoughts with words and by actually sharing how you feel and I'm really proud of you for that.
        I could also say it like, you've grown into a warm person, it's just so nice to have you as a friend you can't even begin to imagine and I'm very grateful for that.
        AND FR YOU GO ALL "ITS JUST BASIC SHIT CHILL" BUT ITS NOT, SO LEMME JUST END THIS BY THANKING YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING THERE CAUSE IT'S NOT BASIC SHIT IT'S YOU SHIT.`

        description: `Ayooooooooo what's poppin my lad? For today's update we haveeeeeee: the ingredient thing has its structure done, I also coded the function that makes it open on click but still taking it quite chill.
        Gotta say tho yesterday I was kinda mentally gone cause I ranked too much on IDV but WTF you surprised me so much. NO FLAME AT ALL but you sometimes forget stuff so I thought I'd have to remind you of the soup drawing. It surprised me a lot that not only you remembered but you even told me you were watching tutorials on how to draw it well, like broooooooo, I feel bad for doubting on that but at the same time it's times like these that make me realize how good of a friend you're.
        The amount of effort you put in even in these small things make me appreciate you a whole lot, HAHAHAHA I REMEMBER YESTERDAY I KINDA SAID SOMETHING SIMILAR, NO? I don't want these entries to be too repetitive so if you're reading this just know you're truly amazing and OMG I won the fucking lottery by having a friend like you.
        Unrelated but I won't stop stealing your Genshin butterflies, those are mine sorry.`
