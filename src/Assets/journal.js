        description: `OK, so actually I hadn't planned for this thing, I'm not even sure if I'll use but I'm kinda seriously considering it rn
        Since this is day one I don't really wanna commit too hard to anything. I kinda suck at designing things so I was thinking maybe a layout like the IDV event going on rn would be kinda nice, you know, the one where you pick gifts and guess who's gifting em.
        Ngl tho since there's also an IDV journal it kinda feels like I'm taking everything from there... I SWEAR I'M NOT AN IDV ADDICT AND I'M TRYNA COME UP WITH SHIT MYSELF BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS
        Also I have two months so I'm sure there'll be some changes, right? You tell me. Making this gift is kinda hard cause what I'm tryna convey more than anything else is something meaningful, I REALLY DON'T WANNA BE CRUNCHY, I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS IN ANY OTHER WAY, but there's things you've done and said to me that really have meant the world.
        BRO THAT DAY YOU WENT FUCKING ALL CRUNCHY OUT OF NOWHERE AND FUCKING KO'D ME WAS CRAZY.
        No, but real real real Imma try hard to make this gift what I want it to be, hope you like it cause Imma pour my everything into itttttt.
        Also yesterday was the day you said we should study cats so we can also eat ourselves out, CRAZYYYYYYYYYYYYY.
        DAY ONE OVER, SEE YOU TOMORROW`

        description: `Now I think I got a good and kinda original idea, Imma make a soup, like an actual soup. Basically it's the gifts thing I was telling you about but in soup, and it's kinda like every single thing in there is a part of you, what makes you who you are.
        I didn't have much time today cause I had to get college + the other course I'm taking shit done but tomorrow Imma start with the actual coding part. Also we played like infinite hours today so I blame you too. With all that talk about you sucking Shenhe's toes and all that you made me laugh so fucking hard my chest started to hurt, then we both got legendaries from the Poketwo bot and lost like four duo matches in a row. A pretty good day I'd say.`

        description: `I got the biggest scam ever, IT'S FUCKING LIT. All I gotta do is trick you into drawing the soup and the ingredients so I can use em later, AM I A GENIUS OR WHAT?
        I'm about to get started with the code so there's at least a structure to fit that into.
        We haven't talked yet so can't update on that but looking forward to asking if your gases got better :D
        This line is like half an hour later but now that I'm coding the thing I have to wonder if it's better to make the ingredient thing like a memory, like special moments or things you've done for me or if it's better to write something myself.
        Last year I also did a memories thing so I'm not too sure if it wouldn't be kinda repetitive, thing is tho I wanna show appreciaton but I also wanna remind you of how awesome you're so I'm a bit conflicted.
        Well, it's whatever, there's almost two months left so I'll figure it out, I'm just setting the outlines rn, I BELIEVEEEEEEEEE.`
