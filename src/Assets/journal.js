        Since this is day one I don't really wanna commit too hard to anything. I kinda suck at designing things so I was thinking maybe a layout like the IDV event going on rn would be kinda nice, you know, the one where you pick gifts and guess who's gifting em.
        Ngl tho since there's also an IDV journal it kinda feels like I'm taking everything from there... I SWEAR I'M NOT AN IDV ADDICT AND I'M TRYNA COME UP WITH SHIT MYSELF BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS
        Also I have two months so I'm sure there'll be some changes, right? You tell me. Making this gift is kinda hard cause what I'm tryna convey more than anything else is something meaningful, I REALLY DON'T WANNA BE CRUNCHY, I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS IN ANY OTHER WAY, but there's things you've done and said to me that really have meant the world.
        BRO THAT DAY YOU WENT FUCKING ALL CRUNCHY OUT OF NOWHERE AND FUCKING KO'D ME WAS CRAZY.
        No, but real real real Imma try hard to make this gift what I want it to be, hope you like it cause Imma pour my everything into itttttt.
        Also yesterday was the day you said we should study cats so we can also eat ourselves out, CRAZYYYYYYYYYYYYY.
        DAY ONE OVER, SEE YOU TOMORROW`

        description: `Now I think I got a good and kinda original idea, Imma make a soup, like an actual soup. Basically it's the gifts thing I was telling you about but in soup, and it's kinda like every single thing in there is a part of you, what makes you who you are.
        I didn't have much time today cause I had to get college + the other course I'm taking shit done but tomorrow Imma start with the actual coding part. Also we played like infinite hours today so I blame you too. With all that talk about you sucking Shenhe's toes and all that you made me laugh so fucking hard my chest started to hurt, then we both got legendaries from the Poketwo bot and lost like four duo matches in a row. A pretty good day I'd say.`

        description: `I got the biggest scam ever, IT'S FUCKING LIT. All I gotta do is trick you into drawing the soup and the ingredients so I can use em later, AM I A GENIUS OR WHAT?
        I'm about to get started with the code so there's at least a structure to fit that into.
        We haven't talked yet so can't update on that but looking forward to asking if your gases got better :D
        This line is like half an hour later but now that I'm coding the thing I have to wonder if it's better to make the ingredient thing like a memory, like special moments or things you've done for me or if it's better to write something myself.
        Last year I also did a memories thing so I'm not too sure if it wouldn't be kinda repetitive, thing is tho I wanna show appreciaton but I also wanna remind you of how awesome you're so I'm a bit conflicted.
        Well, it's whatever, there's almost two months left so I'll figure it out, I'm just setting the outlines rn, I BELIEVEEEEEEEEE.`

        description:  `Well, scam was successful and I think I convinced you to do it, tho I'm not sure if you remember... I'll remind you later anyways.
        Today I'm not really sure if Imma do anything coding related to this so instead let's just talk about a nice moment we had yesterday / this morning.
        WAIT WRITING THIS I HAD AN IDEA OF HOW THIS COULD GO INTO A MEMORY, MAYBE I'LL ACTUALLY AT LEAST CODE THAT.
        No but without going into too much detail cause it'd be too long and I'm still not sure how long I want these entries to be, I told you about my being a bit underweight thing now and the way you reacted like, I knew you were like this but seeing it once again reminded me of how proud I am of what you've become and also made me feel really happy of being your friend.
        You know, back when I met you you used to show you cared by hurting yourself, by closing yourself, by trying not to bother others but it was also a bit like you were afraid, like you couldn't show your true self and you were scared of people leaving you. And while to some extent I know you still do that, today you've proven me that it's not your only way to show appreciation, cause now you can also show you care but in a positive way, by being there for others, by expressing your thoughts with words and by actually sharing how you feel and I'm really proud of you for that.
        I could also say it like, you've grown into a warm person, it's just so nice to have you as a friend you can't even begin to imagine and I'm very grateful for that.
        AND FR YOU GO ALL "ITS JUST BASIC SHIT CHILL" BUT ITS NOT, SO LEMME JUST END THIS BY THANKING YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING THERE CAUSE IT'S NOT BASIC SHIT IT'S YOU SHIT.`

        description: `Ayooooooooo what's poppin my lad? For today's update we haveeeeeee: the ingredient thing has its structure done, I also coded the function that makes it open on click but still taking it quite chill.
        Gotta say tho yesterday I was kinda mentally gone cause I ranked too much on IDV but WTF you surprised me so much. NO FLAME AT ALL but you sometimes forget stuff so I thought I'd have to remind you of the soup drawing. It surprised me a lot that not only you remembered but you even told me you were watching tutorials on how to draw it well, like broooooooo, I feel bad for doubting on that but at the same time it's times like these that make me realize how good of a friend you're.
        The amount of effort you put in even in these small things make me appreciate you a whole lot, HAHAHAHA I REMEMBER YESTERDAY I KINDA SAID SOMETHING SIMILAR, NO? I don't want these entries to be too repetitive so if you're reading this just know you're truly amazing and OMG I won the fucking lottery by having a friend like you.
        Unrelated but I won't stop stealing your Genshin butterflies, those are mine sorry.`

        description: `No cap I'm still not sure what this journal is about so I'll keep writing whatever I guess.
        Today is a bit diff cause for the past days I was writing about what we did the day before + beginning of that day but for today cause we didn't talk yesterday I'll only write today's shit. A whole lot tho cause, fuck me, most of the day went straight up into our convo.
        I was actually getting a bit worried today cause you hadn't played anything in two days and were taking forever to reply, which tbf is pretty normal, but I wasn't gonna say anything until tomorrow in case in reality it was nothing. Turns out you got sick af and yeah, basically fucking dying.
        Besides that I swear I can't tell if I'm dumb af or what but the surprises never stop coming with you, playing on your IDV alt was a pretty nice gesture but I thought it was just cause it was your alt, but today you let me into your main like it's whatever. AND WANNA KNOW THE REASON WHY? YOUR ALT WAS THE ACCOUNT YOU SPENT MONEY ON SO YOU WERE LETTING ME INTO YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ACCOUNT AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. LIKE, BE HONEST, WHAT DO I EVEN DO AFTER THIS? BRO FUCKER IF YOU READ THIS LEMME SAY THE AMOUNT OF TRUST YOU PLACE IN ME, THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT YOU PUT IN, HOW MUCH YOU CARE, AND I'M NOT GONNA CONTINUE CAUSE I GOTTA LEAVE THINGS FOR OTHER ENTRIES BUT ALL THOSE THINGS, all the things you do, how do you even describe this? You're a fucking national treasure, a wordly treasure, you're legit irreplaceable, I don't think I could ever find anybody like you or even close.
        I did let you into my Genshin account after, which I know it's not the same but it's the minimum I could do, and honestly, the amount of trust I also have for you is HUGE, at no point I was worried while you were on it and you know anytime you wanna play on it again you're free too. Bro, fr, everyday with you is an experience HAHAHAHAH, you're gonna make me cry if this goes on, you're so fucking nice wtf, IS GETTING MOVED THIS MUCH EVERDAY HEALTHY? NO IDEA BUT 10/10 FRIEND, WOULD CALL CRY CHARACTERS UGLY AGAIN.`

        Imma add a skip thing to this entry or something so it doesn't even show on the thing`,

        description: `OKAYYYYY I GOT CONTENT. I think maybe tho I'll stop writing entries every single day cause I don't want this thing to be like infinite either, this is kinda an extra thing.
        I'm still mostly stalling cause waiting for the souppppppppppp.
        I gotta say tho, you're mad funny, you spammed me to sleep and you pull a fucking all-nighter for IDV, AND THEN YOU GO "NONONONO I HATE IDV", YOU SURE DO, NO DOUBT. Still got smacked on memory tho, no matter how tired I may be, no matter how strong the headache, no matter how much you can RNG the start, nothing can stop my 6 combo. G3T R3KT M8.
        Chill day all considered.`

        description: `Sup buddy! For once Imma write an entry that's only related to the project, okay? So I had an enlightenment moment and I kinda understand now what I wanna do with the ingredients. I want em to be like a card, with a memory in front and then you can turn em, an animation will play and everything, and then on the other side there'll be a note written by me, with a title attached and maybe something you also did? I think that's kinda what I wanna achieve with this, I want something that showcases our friendship, the way I see you and the way you show yourself. Cause I can say all the nice things I want and we can share all the nice moments we can but I think it's also important you realize this is only possible cause of what you do.
        Oh btw, unrelated but HAHAHAHAH, the "STOP BEING SO INTERESTING, YOU'RE MAKING ME AWFUL" compliment was kinda interesting, I'll save it as one of the niceirdest compliments I've received. Is that toxic? Idk, kinda sounds like it but thankssssssssss.`

        description: `I won't lie, I didn't write anything yesterday cause I was stressing about our friendship discussion, the one about who texts first, time spent and all that. BRO YOU CALLED ME OVER AND STARTED WTIH THE I WANNA BUY YOU A SHINY LUXRAY AND I WAS LIKE TF? WASN'T SHE GONNA FLAME THE SHIT OUT OF ME? Truly confused af, but honestly, why do I even doubt you anymore, you straight up just said the plan and the fact by next morning things had already changed really shows your character.
        I was thinking about how I wanted the ingredient cards to be and I think I have a clearer idea now, I want the memory to actually be on the back cause it's like a nice thing but not the main point, I want the front to be the meaningful part. And until now I didn't have a super clear idea and didn't know with what to start, but yesterday helped me figure a lot of shit out and that's why I decided to make that the first card.
        Ofc there has been lots of other good moments that I also treasure but this one in particular I feel like it's perfect for what I wanted, it's not gonna be the only one so I can still fit more shit.
        Oh and btw, thanks for listening to my personal stuff and sharing yours, actual peak friend. OK BYEEEEEEEE SAYANARA.`

        description: `HAHAHAHAH feels bad that after what I said last I went three days without writing anything. It's true that one day was pretty normal so there wasn't much to write about and the one after we just didn't chat but I gotta be honest and say that maybe I've been a little unfair sometimes.
        You know, sometimes I feel like I don't understand you and I feel bad bringing shit up cause it's probs not on purpose but just something you missed or misunderstood, or maybe even myself being too much, but yesterday you honestly left me shocked. I won't talk about the specifics cause I'd rather write about positive things but I felt a bit hurt by something that had been going on for a while and I thought I was being subtle about it. Like I just wanted to understand better, not really pressure or blame you for anything, but you literally connected all the dots idk how and even got to the part I didn't say or was gonna say. And that wasn't just it, I didn't have to ask or say shit, you legit apologized instantly even tho I didn't even mention or confirm it, what do I do after that? Like fr, what bro?
        I won't lie in that things that have been done have been done but these kind of situations not only show me your growth but also how much further you can keep growing and I feel proud af of you. Makes me really happy to have you as a friend cause we all make mistakes but the way you approach these situations and learn from em is truly something I admire, and honestly, something I aspire to reach at some point too.
        I feel that for myself I may need you to spell things out for me or I may not be the best at reassuring you but just know that I'm also trying my best cause both you and this friendship mean the world to me.
        Like, real talk, totally honest, situations that make me worried or things that make me wonder if they're gonna affect our friendship you make em seem like it's nothing, you're always making the right choice and saying the right things. It's fr a it's much worse in your head thing cause once we talk it out it always ends well, BRO I FEEL SO BAD FOR DOUBTING YOU SOMETIMES, LIKE DID I REALLY DOUBT THIS GIRL OMAIGAAAAAAH.
        I'll also take this entry to say that I know that I've hurt you in the past and while we don't talk about these things cause it's awkward and probs bring back bad memories I just wanted to mention that I'm truly sorry and thanks for staying my friend after all that, I promise I'll keep doing my best cause you fucker, you literally make it so hard to catch up I gotta put in x100 the effort, YOURE JUST TOO GOOD, STOPPPPPPPP.
        Alright, think that's all, just another day of having a universal treasure as a friend, you rock lil buddy.`

        description: `It's been a whileeeeee, right? Ngl so much has happened that idk where to start. With the primogem farm, college, watching arcane and playing together honestly I never found the right moment to write this. It's probs not the play rn either cause we're supposed to play in a bit but still, I didn't want to leave this this abandoned.
        I never stopped working on the gift tho, I've been saving memories and I won't spoil but there are some pretty nice ones.
        Nowww, if we're gonna talk about these past days there's been a lot of things so I'll just list some of em and you can help me with the rest by remembering by yourself, teamwork, right?
        I WANNA START THIS BY SAYING YOU'RE SO FUCKING ADORABLE, LIKE NO CAP, STRAIGHT UP ADORABLE AF. You know when you're like all emotional and can't say this it's just so fucking funny HAHAHA and worst thing is that after that you throw KO's around for no reason, like bruvvvvv. You may hate me for saying this but the other day when you were gonna eat and say "ily" and instant left, HAHAHAHAH IT WAS SO FUNNYYYYYYYYY, but it also made me happy, I could tell it was genuine and those moments are moments I treasure. I actually wanted that as a memory here but you kicked me soooooooooo. Fuck you bro.
        HAHAHAHA NOW YOU JUST INTERRUPTED ME ON DISC SO I GOTTA HURRY THE FUCK UP BET.
        NO BUT ALSO you started to play TFT and like, I could tell you were doing it just for me, you really do a lot of things just for me and I don't wanna sound like I fucking want you to dedicate your life to me but the fact you're so caring and thoughtful make me value you a fuck ton.
        I told you before, I give just to give, cause you're important to me, I don't expect anything in return and yet you fucking top me every single time, FEELS BAAAAAAAD.
        I'm also glad we could talk about shit that happened in the past and that maybe wasn't so nice and still not only keep our friendship intact but make it stronger. When I decided to reconnect with you you asked me what changed and what would make it so this time our friendship doesn't fail. Back then I had my doubts and I tried be as sincere as I could, I ofc wouldn't have tried if I didn't think we could be friends again but our current status rn is far beyond my expectations. I DON'T WANNA GET ALL CRUNCHY CAUSE I GOTTA PLAY WITH YOU IN LIKE 5 MINUTES but can't even imagine how special both our friendship and you are to me.
        I'd write a long ass lists of reasons of why I think our friendship works but I feel like there's no need, I'm sure you can think of it too.
        You said I better you but honestly you better me too so much and I think that the people we're now are so diff from the people we were back then and that not only makes me sure this friendship would go on for a long time but also makes me excited for the future. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PHRASE THIS WHOLE THING AND I'M ALSO IN TIME TROUBLE BUT BRO LIKE I'LL PROTECT OUR FRIENDSHIP AT ALL COSTS, YOU CAN BE SURE OF THAT, I'LL PROTECT BOTH OUR FIENDSHIP AND YOU AT ALL COSTS.
        OKAY TIME IS UP, SORRY, I'LL UPDATE THIS TOMORROW, CYAAAAAAAA`
